Example Playbooks

VIP stickiness
==============

There is 2 servers in BACKUP mode and the `nopreempt` option. On start, server with
higher priority becomes MASTER and manages the VIP. If the MASTER fail, the other
server takes over the VIP and become MASTER. If the previous MASTER server comes back,
the VIP remains on the current server (thanks to `nopreempt` option) even with a lower
priority.

```yaml

# Node 1
keepalive__vip: 192.168.200.254
keepalive__authentication_pass: {{ password }}
keepalive__service:
  - name: haproxy
    script: "/usr/bin/killall -0 haproxy"
    interval: 2
    fall: 2
    rise: 2
    # no weight to transition to FAULT state
keepalive__instance: loadbalancer
keepalive__virtual_router_id: 60
keepalive__instance_state: BACKUP
keepalive__nopreempt: true
keepalive__instance_priority: 101

# Node 2
# (same config except: )
keepalive__instance_priority: 102
```

SMTP alert
==========
To send an e-mail when a transition state occur:

```yaml
keepalive__smtp_alert: true
keepalive__global_defs:
  smtp_server: localhost 25
  notification_email: [ 'foo@example.com]
```

Notification scripts
====================

Execute a script for 'all' state transition, where valid keys are 'all', 'master', 'backup', 'fault'

```yaml
keepalive__notify_scripts:
  all:
    username: root
    groupname: root
    shell: |
        #! /bin/bash
        echo "$(date) keepalive $@" >> /var/log/keepalived.log
```

Execute a script when a server becomes MASTER:

```yaml
keepalive__notify_scripts:
  master:
    username: root
    groupname: root
    shell: |
        #! /bin/bash
        echo "$(date) keepalive I'am the MASTER" >> /var/log/keepalived.log
```
